Aikido of Northern Virginia is a not-for-profit organization governed by a board of directors
elected from and by the membership. Instead of paying for individual lessons,
students pay monthly membership dues. All students assist in the maintenance of the dojo.

We pride ourselves on maintaining the dojo – not only as a place for serious Aikido training and discipline –
but also as a place with a sense of belonging and concern for each other.
