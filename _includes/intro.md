# Welcome to Aikido of Northern Virginia

Aikido of Northern Virginia,
located across the street from Ballston metro station in Arlington, Northern VA,
is a traditional aikido dojo afiliated to [aikikai hombu dojo](http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/)
through the <a href="http://asu.org/">aikido schools of Ueshiba.


Aikido of Northern Virginia is a not-for-profit organization governed by a board of directors
elected from and by the membership. Instead of paying for individual lessons,
students pay monthly membership dues. All students assist in the maintenance of the dojo.

We pride ourselves on maintaining the dojo – not only as a place for serious Aikido training and discipline –
but also as a place with a sense of belonging and concern for each other.
