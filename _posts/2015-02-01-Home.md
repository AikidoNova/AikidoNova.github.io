#Welcome to Aikido of Northern Virginia

Aikido of Northern Virginia currently holds classes six days a week, and offers seminars throughout the year. We are metro accessible as well.  

Please check back often for updates.

The dojo's foul weather policy is to close if any portion of the Metro is closed. This applies to the entire Metro system. If Metro closes the above-ground stations and only the below-ground stations are open, then the dojo will be closed.
