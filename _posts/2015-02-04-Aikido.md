Aikido is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba, who is often referred to by his title, 'O-Sensei' ('Great Teacher'). On a purely physical level, aikido technique involves throws and joint controls that are derived from traditional sword and spear arts. Aikido focuses not on striking opponents, but rather on using the force of an attack to redirect the attacker's movement or position relative to the defender. Aikido practice is not static, but instead places great emphasis on position and the dynamics of movement.

Aikido may be translated as the way of harmony of spirit. O-Sensei emphasized that the study of aikido was a moral and spiritual discipline as well as a physical one, and he placed great weight on the development of a noble and peaceful character. While aikido (like any other martial art) offers the practitioner the immediate opportunity to study self-defense technique and improve his or her physical health, in the long term aikido offers spiritual discipline and peace of mind. Although the idea of a martial discipline striving for peace and harmony may seem paradoxical, it is the most basic tenet of the art.
