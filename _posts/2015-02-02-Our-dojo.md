Aikido of Northern Virginia was founded in September 1999. Prior to that time, the dojo was Northern Virginia Budokan.

Aikido of Northern Virginia is a not-for-profit organization governed by a board of directors elected from and by the membership. Instead of paying for individual lessons, students pay monthly membership dues. All students assist in the maintenance of the dojo.

We pride ourselves on maintaining the dojo -- not only as a place for serious Aikido training and discipline -- but also as a place with a sense of belonging and concern for each other.
